# PLAN

This step in the Conservation Standards cycle focuses on developing key components
of your overall **conservation plan** . Specifically, it involves using and building on
your work in the Assess Step to define and develop your project’s scope, actions,
theories of change, and associated goals and objectives (i.e., your **strategic plan** ). It
also involves clarifying specific **information needs** and indicators and how you will
monitor these ( **monitoring plan** ) and laying out how you will operationalize your
work, considering various institutional and contextual factors ( **operational plan** ).
As shown in Figure 8, all this information contributes to your overall conservation
plan. Step 3 Implement includes more information on the work plan element.

As with many of the Conservation Standards steps
and sub-steps, much of what you do in this step will
be iterative. For example, although you develop
an operational plan in Step 2C, you may need to
think about sustainability, **risks**, and transition


plans as you are choosing your actions in Step 2A.
These elements may help your team and senior
managers determine whether to continue with
a specific action or even your overall project.

**2A.  Develop a Formal Strategic Plan: ** **Goals, Actions, Assumptions, and Objectives**


**Goals**

Developing a clear idea of what you would like to
accomplish is an essential early step in putting
together your strategic plan. **Goals** are linked to
your project’s focal values (conservation and/or
human wellbeing) and represent the desired status
of those focal values over the long term. They are
formal statements of the ultimate **impacts** you hope
to achieve. A good goal meets “SMART” criteria:
*specific, measurable, achievable*, *results-oriented*,
and *time* - *limited* (see Annex 2 and Box 6). As with

every step of your plan, your goals will be heavily
influenced by the values of the team involved in their
development. Be sure you are including a variety
of perspectives from many interested parties.

Ideally, your project goals should fit within and
contribute to broader program and/or organizational
goals. Indeed, in some cases, what your project
is expected to achieve may be specified by your
organization and/or statutory requirements. These
external obligations may ultimately influence
your team’s prioritization of actions. Where
possible and relevant, your team also should
consider the opportunity to align your goals

–
(and objectives discussed later) with broader
national, regional, and/or international efforts
(e.g., the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, Sustainable Development
Goals, Convention on Biodiversity, United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples) and specify how your project intends to
contribute to these wider efforts. You should not
force this connection, but rather look for where
there is overlap and potential for alignment.

If you did a viability assessment in Step 1B, you have
already defined the elements of a good goal because
you know the key attributes needed for a healthy
focal value, you know by when you hope to achieve
the desired status, and you know what you need to
measure to assess its health. Developing a goal is
just a matter of converting this viability information
into a goal statement. As an example, a SMART
goal for the forest corridor biodiversity focal value


in Figure 6 might be: By 2035, the forest corridor
linking the White River Watershed to Los Grillos is
at least 5 km wide and remains unfragmented.

If a project has human wellbeing focal values,
then goals should be set for these focal values.
To do so, the team can define key attributes
needed for a healthy human wellbeing focal value.





In a conservation project, these attributes are
typically tied to the ecosystem services provided by
a biodiversity focal value and/or expected results
from conservation actions that directly benefit
human wellbeing. It is good to keep in mind that
there are many dimensions to human wellbeing, not

all of which could be attributable to conservation

work. For example, a conservation team would
probably not have human wellbeing goals related
to decreasing cholesterol levels, even though
heart disease prevention is important for human
health. It may, however, have human wellbeing
goals related to access to food sources because the


conserved biodiversity focal values are improving
crop pollination services. In some cases, however,
projects may have an equal focus on biodiversity and
human wellbeing. Your team will need to be clear
about the scope of your human wellbeing work and
what human wellbeing goals make sense for your
project. Likewise, it is important to understand
when conservation and human wellbeing goals
may be in conflict with one another and to be clear
about what your project can and cannot achieve.
Remember that all human wellbeing goals should be
developed in partnership with the relevant groups
identified in your interested parties assessment.



**35** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

**Actions**

Once you determine what you ultimately want to
achieve (your goals), you should think about what you
need to do (actions and activities). Good strategic
planning involves determining where and how you
will intervene, as well as where you will not. It also
involves transparently and inclusively identifying
whom you need to influence, who holds historical
power, and whose voices need to be elevated.

**Selecting Key Intervention Points**

When developing your actions, you will want to
prioritize the factors you need to influence to
improve the context outlined in your situation
analysis and/or model – these are the **key**
**intervention points** . To identify key intervention
points, you need to evaluate all factors and,
using available evidence (including traditional
knowledge), identify which ones show good


leverage opportunities and are likely to impact

the focal value the most. Some considerations to

evaluate leverage potential include contribution
to threat abatement, ability to influence multiple
factors in the model (including motivations for
and barriers to behavior change), and urgency of
addressing the factor (or its downstream factors).

In theory, any factor in a situation model offers an
opportunity for intervention. In some cases, the
obvious key intervention point is the direct threat
itself (e.g., removing or managing invasive species)
or the biodiversity focal value (e.g., restoration of
an ecosystem). But in many other cases, you will get
more leverage if you intervene on an indirect threat
or opportunity that is part of a chain of factors
affecting a direct threat (e.g., influencing policy or
promoting good management practices). Your team’s
leverage on a factor may depend on your relationship
with the actors involved in that behavior. Figure 9
shows an example of key intervention points and
actions (depicted as hexagons) to address them.


FIGURE **9** **Example Situation Model with Key Intervention Points (Bolded Boxes) and Actions**


**Deciding How and Where**
**You Will Intervene**



Your key intervention points help you determine
where you need to consider conservation actions to
influence your overall situation. The Conservation
Standards define an **action** as a set of one or
more **activities** with a common focus that work
together to achieve specific goals and objectives by
targeting these key intervention points, optimizing
opportunities, and limiting constraints. [9] Actions
should meet the following criteria: *linked, focused,*
*feasible*, and *appropriate* (see Annex 2). Actions are
implemented in the context of a **strategy**, which

includes one or more actions and their associated

expected results and goals and objectives.

There are many types of actions that can be used
for different purposes, such as directly managing
ecosystems or species, influencing human behaviors
(Box 7), or creating **enabling conditions** that
[contribute to strategy effectiveness (see IUCN-CMP](https://conservationstandards.org/library-item/threats-and-actions-taxonomies/)
[Conservation Actions Classification for a complete](https://conservationstandards.org/library-item/threats-and-actions-taxonomies/)
list of potential actions). Working off your situation
analysis, you should generate a list of possible actions
to influence your identified key intervention points.



9 In CS 5.0, we have substituted the term “action” for the previously used term “strategy” to better fit how the rest of the world uses these terms. An action
is now a component of a broader strategy.

It is good practice to test your actions to see how
well they work before implementing them. If you
determine there is strong evidence that an action
will be effective in a project’s context, you can
then implement it at the appropriate scale. If the
evidence is more mixed or not available, you may
wish to conduct additional testing or pilot the
action and use adaptive management to determine
its effectiveness for your context. If you do move
ahead with actions that lack sufficient evidence
of effectiveness for your context, it is wise to
consider the risks to your project of doing so and
also make sure you closely monitor the action.

Finally, it is important that your project has
appropriate environmental and **social safeguards**
in place. This involves assessing approaches to


avoid or mitigate potential adverse social and
environmental effects of your actions, especially
on interested parties with low influence and high
interest. Throughout the project, your team
will need to regularly consider the vulnerability,
dignity, human rights, traditional knowledge, land
and resource ownership, and cultural heritage
and practices of affected groups. It is important
to identify unintended consequences, feedback
loops, and tradeoffs that can occur and that can
affect people, biodiversity, and your project itself.
While it is useful and prudent to review social
and environmental safeguards throughout the
project cycle, it is especially important in the
strategy design phase, as strategies and actions
may need adaptations or considerations to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate potential negative effects.



**Assumptions &**
**Theories of Change**

Once your team has selected your actions, you
should clarify the causal **assumptions** about
how you think each action will help you achieve
**intermediate results** and longer-term biodiversity
and human wellbeing goals. These assumptions,
as well as assumptions about other factors that
need to be in place for your action to succeed,
represent your **theory of change** . Your theory of
change can be expressed in text, diagrammatic
(i.e., **results chain** ), or other forms. [10]

If you portray your situation analysis in a situation
model, you can use that as the basis for developing


your results chains (Figure 11 shows a generic
example, while Figure 12 shows an example based
off of Figure 9). Doing so helps you explicitly
show how your action is intended to affect the
current state (portrayed in your situation model)
to achieve the desired state (portrayed in your
results chain). While the results and assumptions
in your theories of change should be based
on existing evidence, some assumptions may
lack evidence. As such, your team may have
uncertainty about whether your expected results
can be achieved and if there are potential risks of
undesirable outcomes. It is important to identify
and prioritize these evidence gaps for attention
(e.g., the dotted line in Figure 12 indicates an
uncertainty in the team’s assumptions).


10 While some people think that results chains are the same as logical frameworks (logframes) or logic models, they differ in important ways. Logframes
provide a simple way of organizing goals and objectives, but, unlike results chains, they do not explicitly link actions, objectives, and goals. Logic models
are more similar to results chains, but results chains have the flexibility to show more detail, branching, and the direct relationship between one result and
another.

Often, your results chains (and, more broadly,
your theories of change) will include key **activities**
needed to implement your action successfully.
Adding these activities can help clarify how you
expect to achieve one or more specific results.
It is also useful to make sure your results contain
information about key psychological and
social states ( **psycho** - **social states** ), including


actors’ beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and context for
their behavior. This will help clarify why you think
specific activities will lead to behavioral outcomes.
This is a good point to consider your team’s ability
to make accurate assumptions about the actors
involved, their behavior, and the power dynamics or
barriers they may face in changing the situation.

**43** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

If your team identified human wellbeing focal values
in your situation model, you should also use your
theory of change to show how you believe your
project’s actions will improve human wellbeing
(Figure 13 provides an example that shows how
ecosystem services might contribute to human
wellbeing). Keep in mind that conservation teams
also often work on important social issues that have
benefits and address interests beyond biodiversity
(e.g., building capacity for good governance or
promoting sustainable livelihoods). In such cases,


the conservation action provides social benefits in
service of conservation. It is useful to clarify when
your conservation actions are contributing to
human wellbeing focal values via ecosystem services
and when they are contributing more directly
via conservation actions. Figure 14 shows these
relationships generically, while Figure 15 illustrates a

                 specific example where an eco certification action
could contribute to human wellbeing both directly via
increased logger incomes (which is also a necessary
result for conservation) and via ecosystem services.




FIGURE **13** **Example Results Chain Extract with Ecosystem Services and Human Wellbeing Focal Values**



FIGURE **14** **High** - **level Relationships of How Conservation Actions Can Contribute to Human Wellbeing**

FIGURE **15**
**Example of Conservation Action Directly Benefiting Humans**


Results chains can be used to show the **outcomes**
of the project’s specific work, as well as longer-term
outcomes that may be beyond the manageable
interests and/or timeframe of the project. Some
projects may hope to achieve improvements in
their focal values, while others may only intend


to get as far as a threat reduction result (e.g.,
reduced plastic debris in oceans, Figure 16) or even
an intermediate result (e.g., policymakers enact
laws limiting plastics). In these latter cases, the
ultimate threat reduction and/or conservation

result may be more implicit than explicit.


FIGURE **16** **Example of a Project with a Manageable Interest Not Directly Tied to Biodiversity**

**Objectives**

**Objectives** are formal statements of the outcomes
(or intermediate results in your results chains)
that you believe are necessary to attain your
goals. Objectives specify the degree of change
that your team assumes is necessary to achieve
in the short and medium term. Your objectives

should be clear about the actors and the desired

behaviors. Good objectives (and goals) meet
“SMART” criteria: *specific, measurable, achievable,*
*results* - *oriented,* and *time* - *limited* (See Annex 2).

As shown in Figure 12, your objectives are tied to
the results that are necessary for your theory of
change to hold. It is generally good practice to
have an objective for the direct threat (unless this
is outside your manageable interest, as illustrated


in Figure 16). This direct threat objective (and
its target value) should be informed by the goal
you set for your biodiversity focal value. It will
be important to work through each objective
to define what is appropriate and to ensure that
the criteria for good objectives are met. You may
need to use an iterative approach, revisiting and
refining your objectives (and/or your actions and
associated theories of change) as more information

becomes available. Box 8 includes some additional

considerations for setting objectives.

The goals and objectives specified in your theories
of change represent what you need to accomplish.
Together, with your theory of change, they clarify
your assumptions about how your actions will
help you reach those accomplishments and how
you will gauge the progress of your project.

**46** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

         **Strategic Plan** **Pulling**
**It All Together**

You should capture and document your scope,
situation analysis, and actions (including theories
of change, goals, and objectives) formally in your
strategic plan (refer back to Figure 8). Establishing

              a structured, technology based system to link
your actions to your results, goals, and objectives
will enhance tracking and accountability.
Depending on your needs and the level of detail
required, this system could range from a simple
table to something more comprehensive, such
as a database, with folder hierarchies to organize
and store documents. A clear system will help
you keep all relevant data and documentation
organized, accessible, and easily updated.

**2B.  Develop a Formal Monitoring, Evaluation, ** **and Learning Plan**



This sub-step includes outlining monitoring,
evaluation, and learning protocols to develop a
comprehensive **monitoring plan** . Your monitoring
plan will help you track progress towards stated
goals and objectives, evaluate progress along and
key assumptions associated with your theory of
change, and address information needs related
to uncertainties identified earlier (e.g., in your
situation analysis, action selection, or theories
of change). The monitoring plan will also be
helpful in identifying the resources needed
for implementation, developing a timeline for
data collection and analysis, and reflecting on
potential risks. The level of rigor and the type
of monitoring you do will depend upon your
confidence in your key assumptions (i.e., the
degree of evidence to support your assumptions),
the consequences of being wrong, the stage
of your project, and available resources.


**Audiences and**
**Information Needs**

To start developing your monitoring plan, you should
specify your **audiences** and their **information**
**needs** . Effective **monitoring** uses the minimum
amount of financial and human resources to provide
you with the information needed to address key
uncertainties and/or determine if your project
is on track and achieving stated objectives.

As a first step, you should determine for whom
you are doing the monitoring, what they need to
know for decision making, when they need the
information, and what level of rigor is required
to meet their needs. For example, one audience
might be your project’s funders who need to
know you are spending their money appropriately.
Another audience might be interested parties

**48** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

(including Indigenous Peoples and local communities)

who want to know whether their concerns and

interests are being addressed. A key audience
for monitoring is always your own project team.
Monitoring is essential to help your team track
the implementation of actions and achievement
of goals and objectives, test assumptions in your
theories of change, reduce uncertainties, learn from
information collected, and improve current and
future programming. Table 2 lists some common
audiences and their general information needs.

By focusing your monitoring efforts squarely on
the core assumptions you have made (illustrated in
your situation model and results chains) and the key
uncertainties you have identified, you are more likely
to collect only the information that will be useful for


addressing specific information needs (e.g., status of
threats, achievement of results, areas of uncertainty).

If your monitoring is designed to help understand
why actions are working or not, make sure to monitor
not just specific results, objectives, or goals, but
also key factors that may contribute to or detract
from your ability to achieve your desired results.
This could include monitoring barriers and enabling
conditions beyond your control, as well as changes
to behavior and related psycho-social states for
key actors. When prioritizing information needs,
it is useful to think about the risks to your project
of not having this information, how you will use the
information for management decisions, and whether

it is feasible to address the information needs within
the confines of your project’s resources and timeline.

**Indicators**

With your audiences and information needs
identified, the next step is to define the specific
**indicator** data and other information you should
collect to address your information needs. Good
indicators meet the criteria of being *measurable,*
*precise, consistent*, and *sensitive* and should be
tied to key factors, results, or assumptions in
your situation model or theory of change (see
Annex 2). Note that some indicators may be
qualitative, while others may be quantitative.
Likewise, as discussed below, there are a variety of
methods to measure any single indicator. Where
relevant, indicators also should be informed by
the perspectives and values for biodiversity held
by Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

Through your situation model, theories of change,
and goals and objectives, you have clarified your
focus and prioritized your information needs. These


could include: addressing gaps in your situation
model, testing assumptions in your situation model
and results chains, and demonstrating progress
towards achieving stated objectives. These inputs
will help you narrow down a nearly infinite set of
potential indicators to a more manageable list and
provide you with a solid framework for focused
data collection, analysis, **evaluation**, and learning.
Figure 17 provides an example of how theories of
change and associated SMART objectives can help
you focus your indicators. You should aim to collect
the minimum data required to meet your critical
information needs. As you monitor progress along
your theory of change, keep in mind that there may
be important factors that are outside your team’s
control but that could have an important influence
on the success of your action (e.g., political situation
or market forces). In these cases, you may want to

monitor these factors with a limited set of indicators

to help you interpret whether you are achieving
your expected results (and why or why not).

**51** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

**Methods**

As you develop your indicators and identify key
information needs, you will need to think about
how you will measure them (i.e., the **methods** you
will use). Examples of methods could range from
conducting wildlife survey transects to downloading
satellite imagery on land use patterns to conducting
key informant interviews to understand interested
party attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors.
Methods should meet the criteria of *accurate,*

       *reliable, cost* *effective, feasible*, and *appropriate*
(see Annex 2). Where possible, monitoring methods

                should be participatory, non extractive, and
address privacy and data sovereignty concerns.

When choosing a method, your team will see that
there is sometimes a tradeoff between a method’s
cost and its accuracy and reliability. The key is to
select the most cost-effective method that will
ensure your data are accurate and reliable enough
to meet your management needs. Depending on
your needs, you may not have to collect primary
data, but instead could take advantage of existing
data. For example, one method for getting data
about a given fish population would be to download
harvest records posted by a government agency
on the internet. In some instances, however,

primary data collection will be required.

It is helpful to document the specific protocols you
use to implement your methods. Doing so will help
in data interpretation, as well as future monitoring
of the same indicators to detect patterns over
time. Ideally, your team should test and adjust
indicators and methods before using them. For
example, you should pilot survey instruments to
ensure they give you the data you need and are not
subject to misinterpretation. Likewise, collecting
baseline data early on could help you test your
methods. If you cannot establish baselines within
the first few months of a project, then most likely
you need to review the methods or the indicators.


          **Monitoring Plan** **Pulling**
**It All Together**

Your audiences, information needs, indicators,
and methods are all part of your monitoring plan.
Your plan should also specify roughly when, where,
and by whom data will be collected (see Table 3 for
an example monitoring plan). As you develop your
monitoring plan, consider how the data collection
process may impact interested parties and how that
information will be stored (addressing any privacy
or data sovereignty concerns). As part of your work
planning and budgeting (Step 3), your team should
include time and financial resources to support
**monitoring activities** and data management.

Finally, and in preparation for Steps 3 (Implement)
and 4 (Analyze & Adapt), your team should consider
protocols for how you will manage and access data
and how you anticipate analyzing and using data to
meet the information needs of your key audiences.
Incorporating information on your indicators,
methods, and supporting data into a structured
system that links your actions to your results,
goals, and objectives will facilitate your team’s
ability to synthesize across all of this information.
Additionally, thinking ahead to Step 5 (Share), it's
also useful for your team to begin planning for the
creation of public data repositories with clear data
collection and management protocols so that
others can understand, use, and reproduce them.

**2C.  Develop an Operational Plan**


Conservation projects are ultimately implemented
by people and institutions. Even the best strategic
plans and monitoring plans are of little utility if
you cannot put them into operation. With this

         in mind, this sub step involves developing an
operational plan for your project. Key components
of an **operational plan** include analyses of:

**•** **Human capacity, skills, and other non** **financial**
**resources** required to implement your project
and what you need to do to develop those
resources, including cultivating partnerships.
You can use your theories of change and
activities to develop high-level time estimates
and to identify the skills required to implement
your actions and the associated monitoring
activities. It is also useful to refer back to your
early work on identifying your team and the
key skills and skill gaps within your team.

**•** **Funding** required to implement your project
and an accounting of your current and potential
sources of these funds. To identify the funding
needed, your team should develop broad
estimates using your analyses of human capacity,
skills, and other resources. Be sure you include
any major equipment expenses (e.g., vehicles).
Again, your theories of change will provide a good
framework for making those high-level estimates.

**•** **Risk factors** of concern for your project and
how they can be addressed. A risk factor is an
uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs,
has a negative effect on at least one project
element (e.g., time, cost, scope, or quality). Risks
can be subdivided into programmatic risks that
affect your situation (e.g., political instability,
drought) and operational risks that affect your
ability to implement the project (e.g., change
in organizational leadership, limited capacity of
partners). A risk assessment should rate both
the probability of the risk factor occurring and
the impact or severity of the risk factor if it
does occur. The purpose of a risk assessment is
to identify issues that could negatively impact
the project’s ability to implement key actions
effectively and/or achieve conservation goals,
including any impacts on rights holders and


other interested parties. A risk assessment also
identifies additional actions necessary to mitigate
or avoid those risks. As such, a risk assessment
is an important input for action selection (Step
2A). A risk assessment template (defined by your
organization, if relevant) is useful to document
and rate your risks, prioritize your efforts, and
re-rate the risks as your project evolves.

**•** **Social safeguards** your team has in place to
protect individuals and communities from
adverse impacts. These safeguards aim to
ensure that the rights, wellbeing, and interests
of vulnerable or marginalized groups are
respected and protected. Some examples of
social safeguard mechanisms include free prior
and informed consent (FPIC) for Indigenous
communities, grievance redress mechanisms,
and training for staff on ethical practices;

**•** **Transition strategy** to clarify how long your
project will last and how you will ensure the
sustainability of your project’s achievements
beyond your team’s involvement. While we
include this element under the operational

       plan sub step, it is important to consider
sustainability and transition options at the
start of your project. Doing so helps ensure
that associated actions are included in your
work plan and can be adapted as your project
evolves. Ignoring these factors can lead to
unrealistic expectations among the project
team and interested parties, which can become
increasingly difficult to manage over time.

The first two components of an operational plan

                    technically form the basis for a (high level) work
plan and budget, both of which are covered more
thoroughly under Step 3. The level of detail and
formality of your operational plan will vary, depending
on the size and complexity of your project. Small
projects may only briefly touch on each of these
topics, whereas large, complex ones might have

an extensive and formal treatment of each.


**54** **CONSERVATION STANDARDS** V 5.0

At the conclusion of the Plan Step, you will now have
most of the products of a conservation plan (Figure 8).
Depending on your needs, you may want to compile
this information into a formal plan. Or, if you are
using software like Miradi, you can maintain this
information in the software and produce the relevant
plans and documentation as needed. This creates a
“living” plan that can be updated easily as your project
evolves. It also enables ongoing linkage of data, such
as budgets, with other organizational systems.
