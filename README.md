# Open Standards v5.0
![alt text](zimage/cover.png) <br>

## Open Standards
The Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) provide an extraordinary resource of best practices for the successful implementation of conservation projects using a five-step management cycle.

The full production document in pdf format is available at the Conservation Standards [Download CS](https://conservationstandards.org/download-cs) page. You may also access the Standards or the Conservation Measures Standards site by clicking the link at the top of the page.

## Conversion
Accessing the Standards is solely possible through a pdf download that can be difficult to find if you're not familiar with the CMP sites. Although not huge in size (~19 mb), the OS pdf can be slow to load even using a local copy. For quicker access, this MyST conversion of of the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation v5.0 uses an executable book format to host the book online indexed by chapters and sub-sections. This version of the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation v5.0 can be found online at [3point.xyz/cmp5](https://3point.xyz/cmp5/). PDF downloads are available for individual chapters (although the markdown to pdf conversion is not yet rendering all figure cross references nor is it possible to include continuous figure numbering as in the original text5--will try to resolve in the future). 

:::{warning} Changes to the Original Text
Select headers, url links, tables, and figures have been edited for brevity and to fit within the MyST executable book format. Some photos have been removed. As a result, this version is not an exact facsimile of the  OS v5.0 nor has CMP endorsed this work. Please see [Download CS](https://conservationstandards.org/download-cs) for the latest version in its published format.
